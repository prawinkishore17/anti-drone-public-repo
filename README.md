##  _Anti-Drone Public Repository_  

## **Note**  
 *This is the **public-facing documentation**. Core code, sensitive algorithms, and experimental results are stored in a **confidential private repository***.

## **Overview**  
*This repository provides a high-level overview of a research-based project on real-time drone detection and defense. The detailed implementation and technical specifics are confidential and maintained in a private repository.*  

---

## **Agenda**  
- *Address the rising threats of unauthorized and hostile drones in restricted airspace.*  
- *Develop scalable and reliable methods for early detection, tracking, and neutralization.*  
- *Enable future R&D and defense applications through modular prototyping.*  

---

## **Objectives**  
- *Build a prototype capable of accurate drone detection and classification.*  
- *Leverage AI-driven approaches for object recognition and motion prediction.*  
- *Integrate sensor fusion concepts (radar, camera, etc.) for improved reliability.*  
- *Ensure the system functions in dynamic and challenging environments with minimal false alarms.*  

---

## **Approach (High-Level)**  
- *Sensor fusion for robust detection and tracking.*  
- *AI/ML models for drone classification.*  
- *Edge computing for real-time processing (prototype tested on embedded hardware).*  
- *Simulation of neutralization methods using controlled prototypes.*  

---

## **Expected Outcomes**  
- *A modular prototype showcasing anti-drone defense workflow.*  
- *Documentation of workflow and methodology for future extensions.*  
- *Foundation for advanced research in airspace security.*
