## Agenda  

### **Problem Identification**  
_Rising threats from unauthorized and hostile drones in restricted airspace._  
_Need for reliable, real-time detection and neutralization systems._  

### **Objective**  
_Develop a prototype capable of detecting, tracking, and responding to drones with high accuracy._  
_Ensure system reliability in dynamic environments with minimal false detections._  

### **Approach**  
_Sensor fusion: Radar + Camera for detection and tracking._  
_Advanced AI models for classification and motion prediction._  
_Real-time processing on Jetson Nano with edge computing._  
_Panâ€“tilt laser module for response simulation._  

### **4. Expected Outcome**  
_A scalable, modular anti-drone system prototype._  
_Workflow documentation for future R&D and defense applications._
